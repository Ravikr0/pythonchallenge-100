# 100 Days of Python Challenge 🚀

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python Challenge**! 🎉 This repository contains 100 Python projects completed over 100 days. Each project is designed to enhance your Python programming skills, covering topics ranging from beginner-friendly concepts to advanced projects.

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized by day, with each day's project stored in a separate file named `Day 1`, `Day 2`, and so on. Each file contains:
- The Python script for the project.
- Additional files as needed (e.g., datasets, images, or configuration files).

Example folder structure:
```
100-days-python-challenge/
├── Day 1/
│   ├── main.py
├── Day 2/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── data.txt
├── Day 3/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── helper.py
│   ├── README.md
...
```
